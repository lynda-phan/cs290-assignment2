    This is a picture of my french bulldog, Maximus. His full name is Maximus Prime. Don't be fooled by his smile. He's actually the biggest grump ever. He behaves more like a child than an actual dog. My fiance and I got him when he was just four months old, and ever since then he's been the cheese to our macaroni and the jelly to our peanut butter sandwhich. I can't image my life without this little guy and I'm proud to call him my best friend! <br><br>

    Maximus loves to go on long walks around the neighborhood and enjoys chewing on tennis balls. The bigger the ball, the better. He recently went head to head with a bowling ball and was devasted when he was unable to break it apart. His face is pretty flat so there was no way he could win but he's stubborn and very determined. Maximus is so awesome that he even has his own instagram account. He has over a thousand followers. A lot more than his own parents combined! :(
